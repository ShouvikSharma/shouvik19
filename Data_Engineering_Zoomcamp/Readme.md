### Data Engineering Zoomcamp

# This is a personal pet project based on this (data-engineering-zoomcamp)[https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file]
# The biggest goal behind this project is to learn an end-to-end data engineering course, and make it as a pilot project for creating data engineering projects based on open-source datasets.
