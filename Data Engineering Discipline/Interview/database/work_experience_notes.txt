1. Purpose of the project is to send mailers to potential customers who would come to our website and avail the offer.
2. To identify potential customers or applicants we have to source this data through a data vendor like TU.
- And to understand how we consume this data, I needed to understand the file structure of the TU datasets.
- would it be one file or mutliple files?
- what would be the primary key identifer for these tables?
- how often does this data delivery refresh would it be once per campaign or would it be multiple times per campaign? SCD 1 or SCD 2.


End use cases
